        <h2 style="background-color: springgreen;"> About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer working on computer vision at a stealth robotics startup. We're creating
                exciting new automation technology for the food industry that has the potential to be revolutionary.

            </p>

            <p>
                I graduated in May 2021 from the University of Toronto with a degree in Robotics 
                Engineering through the <a href = "https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/">Engineering Science</a> 
                program. During my time at school, I worked on computer vision for biomedical applications at the 
                Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and was a co-op student at AMD.

            <p> Unfortunately due to my current company being in stealth mode, I cannot discuss my work here. No matter how cool it is.</p>
        
            <h3> Computer Vision - Controlled Electrical Stimulator for People Suffering from Paralysis</h3>
            <p> In the summer of 2018, I worked with computer vision for the first time. I designed a computer vision - based controller
                for a device that performs Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). FES is the process of applying electrical stimulation to the affected
                muscles of patients suffering from paralysis while they imagine themselves performing an action such as grasping an object. The stimulation
                allows them to effect the action, and repeated sessions have been shown to help patients regain some of their ability to independently perform 
                these actions. My project was to use computer vision to determine how close a patients' hand was to an object they are trying to grasp, 
                and trigger the electrical stimulations automatically. This could potentially allow patients to perform these exercises at home, since 
                the stimulations are typically controlled by a physiotherapist at a clinic.
